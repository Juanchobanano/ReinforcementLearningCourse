 
# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning.
* **Dependency**: *Laboratorio de análisis de datos (DATALAB)*.
* **Teacher**: Juan Esteban Cepeda Baena, student of computer science and business administration of the National University of Colombia (Email: jecepedab@unal.edu.co / juancepeda.gestion@gmail.com; LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-e-cepeda-gestion/; Google Site: https://sites.google.com/view/juancepeda/)
* **Requirements**: Basic knowledge of probability, calculus and computer programming (object-oriented programming).
Hourly Intensity: 9 lectures. 2 hours per lecture (we will dedicate the last 30 minutes of each lecture to practical exercises in order to develop practical knowledge).

### 1. General Objective.
Acquire theoretical and practical knowledge about reinforcement learning as a powerful tool for solving real life problems.


### 2. Specific objectives.
* Develop tools in order the model real life problems and solve them using artificial intelligence.
* Strengthen the concepts, definitions and theorems given in class through practical exercises at the end of each lesson.
* Develop an IA project that implements the tools and methods given on the different lectures.

### 3. Methodology.

Each session will combine theory and practice. We will dedicate the last 30 minutes of each lecture to practical exercises in order to develop practical knowledge, using the concepts and definitions given in the lecture. Besides, students will have to join in groups in order to address and solve a problem proposed at the beginning of the course. Finally, we will dedicate the final session to projects presentations. All lessons will be in Spanish (don't worry!).

### 4. Suggested public.

This course is mainly directed at students with a background in science (mathematics, computer science, physics or statistics), engineering or finance, however, due to the multidisciplinary nature of the course content, anyone who wants to learn about artificial intelligence should participate. 

### 5. Course content.

* Lecture 1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning: About Reinforcement Learning, The Reinforcement Learning Problem, Inside An RL Agent, & Problems within Reinforcement Learning.

* Lecture 2. Markov Decision Processes (MDP’s): Markov Processes, Markov Reward Processes, Markov Decision Processes & Extensions to MDPs.

* Lecture 3. Planning by Dynamic Programming: Policy Evaluation, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Extensions to Dynamic Programming, Contraction Mapping Theorem.

* Lecture 4. Model-Free Prediction: Monte-Carlo Learning, Temporal Difference Learning & TD(λ).

* Lecture 5. Model-Free Control: On-Policy Monte-Carlo Control, On-Policy Temporal-Difference Learning, Off-Policy Learning & Summary.

* Lecture 6. Value Function Approximation: Incremental Methods & Batch Methods.

* Lecture 7. Policy Gradient Methods: Finite Difference Policy Gradient, Monte-Carlo Policy Gradient & Actor-Critic Policy Gradient.

* Lecture 8. Integrating Learning and Planning: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, Integrated Architectures & Simulation-Based Search.

* Lecture 9. Exploration and Exploitation: Multi-Armed Bandits, Contextual Bandits & MDPs.

* Lecture 10. Project Presentations: Projects presentations & Course conclusion.

### 6. Assessment.

Assessment will consist in the development of an IA project. At the beginning of the course, each student must select and address a problem that he or she wants to work on through the course duration. Additionally, students must present two project progress reports at the end of lecture 5 and 8 respectively. Finally, we will dedicate the last lesson to projects presentations.
